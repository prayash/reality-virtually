## Creating VR for Humans by Humans by Sandra Rodriguez
### http://hackingvr.mit.edu

You are not a storyteller. - Stefan Sagmeister

### Storytelling
- Imagination + Relation -> Envision the story, and tell it by relating.

VR is not film.
VR is not gaming. A lot of things that work for games do not work for VR. (Eagle Flight by Ubisoft).

#### 1 - There is no box. But there are some guidelines:
- Flirting with an 'audience' `/user/visitor/human`
- A clear narrative: Objective, characters, plot, motives, next steps
- Intuitive arcs (Intro, Peaks, Outro)
- Establish a grammar - what is "normal" here?
- Intuitive interactions (choose a model)
- What's our initial intention?
- What's the 'aha' moment we want them to have?
- When they put the headset down, what do we want them to remember?

#### 2 - Perspective
Stepping away from the frame. Frame is an output.

_The Enemy_ by Karim Ben Khelifa

#### 3 - **FOV** vs. **POV**
- High frame rate + Low latency
- Avoid flickering
- Think of appropriate hea movement / limit uncontrolled movements
- Camera height & surroundings
- Reduced field of view

#### 3 - Designing Immersion
_I, Phillip_ (France, 2016)

Keep reminding the user that there is always something happening in the differents regions of their FOV (Primary Action, Secondary Action, Tertiary Action).
180° Story / 180° Immersion

#### 4 - Perspective
- Designing for 'viewing'
  - Fluidity of movement (60-90 fps)
  - Latency - 50 ms max (<20 ms)
- Designing **worlds** | What/who are you: in STORY, in SPACE, in interACTION
- Remember to reward human curiosity
- 360 vs CGI, VR vs AR - focus on feelings, experiences... (Is visitor 'there' or not?)

#### 5 - Affordances
- Of tools
- Of materials
- Of contents
- Of user in space

How the story is experienced - the affordance of tools and the affordance of the human body.

> If the task of the display is to serve as a looking glass into the mathematical wonderland constructed in computer memory, it should serve as many senses as possible. - Ivan Sutherland

**Proprioception** - Understanding oneself / (The Tomato Effect)

- Full variety of sensory cues
- Be comfortable - avoid straining/fatigue, avoid nausea, avoid 'cybersickness'

#### 6 - Scripting + Storyboarding
```
Choose a tool ->
  - What are the flaws and affordances of this platform?
  - What are the senses (minimum basline) we need to tell/experience this story through this tool/platform?
```

```
Choose an interaction ->
  - What kinds of interaction?
  - Do you want to travel somewhere? Avoid collisions? Select objects & information? Focus and meditate?
```

```
AGENCY & Attention ->
  • Guiding user attention in VR/MR
    - Arrows
    - Light trails
    - Character head movement
    - Thought bubbles
    - Pointers
    - Spatial sound
    - Voice prompts
  
  - Observant     / Passive
  - Participant   / Passive
  - Observant     / Active (Tree)
  - Participant   / Active (Irrational Exuberance)
```

Vincent McCurley's model are super widely shared.

Some quick tips for pitching:
- Logline (3 lines)
- Synopsis (this is the pitch)
- Project Outline
- Material (technology) and interaction design (UI/UX)
- Treatment (visual, audio, music, haptic, experiential)
- Storyboard / Moodboards (visual inspirations)
- Team / Partners

Iterate story, Iterate experience, Iterate interaction.

**Simplicity is usually key.**
